# Page Replacement Algorithms

At the beginning of every program, there are some user variables that can be modified to change its outcome.

```python3
len_pgframes = 3                          # set amount of frames
desired_page_fault = 110                  # 0 for no pgfaults
parse = 1                                 # 1 to parse from data.txt
```

## Usage

The main goal of this program is to ensure the simple execution of these algorithms, and below is an outline of the different ones available.

### FIFO
```bash
python3 fifo.py
```

### LRU
```bash
python3 lru.py
```

### OPT
```bash
python3 opt.py
```
